        },
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a basic asynchronous, non-blocking, interface to EC2 based on
L<Net::EC2::Tiny>. It's relatively compatible while the only difference is
with regards to the callbacks and returned information.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 send

C<send()> expects the same arguments as C<send()> in L<Net::EC2::Tiny>, except
you should also provide two additional arguments.

=head3 success_cb

    $ec2->send(
        ...
        success_cb => sub {
            my $xml = shift;
            # do whatever you want with it
        },
    );

Receives the resulting XML you would normally receive. Then you do whatever
you want with it, such as fetching the information or using it to create
another request.

=head3 fail_cb

    $ec2->send(
        ...
        fail_cb => sub {
            my $error = shift;

            if ( $error->{'type'} eq 'HTTP' ) {
                # this was an HTTP error
                my $http_headers = $error->{'data'}{'headers'};
                my $http_body    = $error->{'data'}{'body'};

                warn 'HTTP error received: ', $error->{'text'};
            } else {
                # $error->{'type'} eq 'XML'
                # this was an XML error
                my $http_headers = $error->{'data'}{'headers'};
                my $http_body    = $error->{'data'}{'body'};
                my $xml          = $error->{'data'}{'xml'};
                my $xml_errors   = $error->{'data'}{'errors'};

                warn "XML error received: ', $error->{'text'};
            }
        },
    );

Since we can't simply C<die> or C<croak> in event-based code (the event loop
would catch it and you won't be able to do much about it), we instead provide
a failure callback. The failure callback receives a hash reference including
all information relevant to the request.

These are the available keys in the returned hash reference:

=over 4

=item C<type>

Either B<HTTP> or B<XML>.

Since there are two possible failures (one being the HTTP request, and the
other being any problems expressed in the XML returned) you can use the C<type>
key to know which type of error you received.

=item C<data>

Additional information for the error.

B<HTTP> error receives the HTTP body (C<body>) and headers (C<headers>).

B<XML> error receives the HTTP body (C<body>), headers (C<headers>), XML data
(C<xml>) and XML errors (C<errors>).

=item C<text>

A string containing the error that occured. This matches the errors returned
by L<Net::EC2::Tiny>.
